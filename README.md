# Top Gear
### The SNES Top Gear game made in Allegro 5

## About
this project was developed for educational purposes as part of the work to complete the discipline of algorithms and data structures of the bachelor's degree course in computer science at UFMG (Federal University of Minas Gerais). If we have any copy-right issues please contact me and i will gladly remove it.

## Installing
In order to run this project you must have the [Allegro 5](https://liballeg.org/) library installed.You can find further information about installing allegro [here](https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Getting_Started).
Note: if you're using an linux environment, your installation is likely as simple as running these three commands:

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:allegro/5.2
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install liballegro5-dev
```

Once you have allegro installed, clone the project into your computer. On the root directory you will find a ```compile``` file which contains the script you need to compile the code (it is possible that I will make a makefile for this in the future, but it is not likely, feel free to pull a request if you are feeling generous). With the code compiled run the executable ```top_gear.tp``` output file to start the game.
